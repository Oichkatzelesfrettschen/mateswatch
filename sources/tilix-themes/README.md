# Tilix-Themes (license unknown)

Upstream:
- Repo: `https://github.com/storm119/Tilix-Themes`
- Commit: `9a60818b8cb43d973e78567e7a47fe4d3bdbc3e3`

This upstream repository does **not** ship an explicit license file at the time of
writing. Because of that, we treat Tilix-Themes content as **reference-only** and
do not include it in release artifacts.

On this machine, `tilix-themes-git` installs `atom.json` into:
- `/usr/share/tilix/schemes/atom.json`

This repo vendors `tilix/schemes/atom.json` byte-identical to the system file
for reproducibility and local comparison only. For redistributable “Atom”-style
MATE Terminal schemes, use the licensed sources already included in this repo
(e.g. `sources/gogh`, `sources/wezterm`, `sources/kitty-themes`).
